                    <dd>
                        The Internet is a globally connected network of networks. Networks include public, private, governmental, business, and academic networks. Using the TCP/IP protocols, the Internet transmits data over various mediums from one computer on one network, traversing other networks to arrive at its destination at another computer on another network.

                <dt>World Wide Web</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The World Wide Web(WWW) is s place where documents and information are shared through the use of hypertext and is accessed over the Internet. The World Wide Web uses a concept called Universal Resource Identider(URI) to assign globally standardized addresses to a website in order to allow open access. The World Wide Web relies heavily on the Client/Server model, where a client(user) requests information from a server located on another network. The server then sends the information back to the user over the Internet.

                <dt>Hypertext</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Hypertext is a key feature of the World Wide Web. Hypertext is text that links to other text, commonly called a "Hyperlink". This allows information to be accesses "non-serially" by creators inserting hypertext in information that allows a reader to immediately jump to an entire different section of information, without the need to peruse the information in a particular order.

                <dt>Multimedia</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Multimedia is multiple types of media displayed alongside each other, such as audio, images, text, interactive content, animations and video.

                <dt>Command Line Interface(CLI)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A way of interacting with a computer where the user issues text commands rather than pointing and clicking with a mouse on a Graphical User Interface(GUI).

                <dt>Graphical User Interface(GUI)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A way of interacting with a computer where the user is able to use a mouse or other pointing devices in order to visually navigate through an interface rather than issuing textual commands on a Command Line Interface(CLI)
                    </dd>
                <dt>Human Computer Interaction(HCI)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The study of how humans interact with computers. Researchers in the area work to design better ways for humans and computers to interact, through better UI design, better input modalities, as well as creating new and novel ways to interact with computers.

                <dt>File Transfer Protocol(FTP)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A protocol designed to allow files to be transferred from one computer to another computer over a network.
                    </dd>
                <dt>Secure Shell(SSH)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A protocol for accessing a computer remotely and securely. SSH uses encryption to mask the remote login session from the network.
                    </dd>
                <dt>Hypertext Transport Protocol(HTTP)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The foundation of the World Wide Web. HTTP is a protocol designed to allow a client to request web pages from a server, and provides structure using hypertext. 
                    </dd>
                <dt>Telnet</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A protocol designed to allow remote login sessions from one computer to another. Due to security concerns, Telnet is better used over a secure local network rather than unsecurely over the Internet.
                    </dd>
                <dt>Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A language used to structure and create web pages and web applications. Web Browsers read HTML and convert it into text and pictures/video/animations for the user to see. HTML is used in conjunction with other technologies like CSS and Javascript in order to make web pages a more rich experience.
                    </dd>
                <dt>Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A language used to control the presentation of web pages. If HTML is the structure of a webpage, CSS controls how the webpage will look and feel. This allows more control over the webpage than could be provided by HTML alone.
