            <h4>Rise of the Internet</h4>
            <p>
                It’s pretty hard to say specifically when the Internet started. The concept of networked social interaction was penned in a series of memos in 1962 by an MIT researcher named J.C.R. Licklider. Licklider envisioned a “globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone could quickly access data and programs from any site.” Pretty much what the Internet has become today(Internet Society.)
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1957, after the launch of the russian satellite Sputnik, the US Government took a more serious approach to science and technology. In response, they created ARPA, the Department of Defense's “Advanced Research Projects Agency” with the goal of developing “space-age” technologies.(History.com Staff)
            </p>
            <p>
                The DOD’s fear was that a single Russian attack could disable the entire phone system, so they came up with the idea of a “packet switching network” that had no single failure point the way the phone system did. They called it the ARPAnet and the first computer to computer message was sent in 1969.(History.com Staff)
            </p>
            <h4>Rise of the ARPAnet</h4>
            <p>
                The Internet as we know it, spawned from the ARPAnet. Several key technologies were invented for the ARPAnet. Telnet, a program for remote logins, was created due to the expensive nature of building computers. It was far easier to allow shared resource use through remote logins. For the same reason, FTP or File Transfer Protocol, was created in order to facility easy file sharing. (Internet Society)
            </p>
            <p>
                Telnet had a flaw however, as was witnessed in 1995 by a Finland native who saw a malicious attack happen at his university. Telnet sends information in plain text, rather than encrypted, and so attackers were able to see passwords being sent over the network. In response, he created SSH, or Secure SHell. SSH allows remote logins through an encrypted(safe!) connection.(A brief history of SSH and remote access.)
            </p>
            <h4>Rise of the World Wide Web</h4>
            <p>
                This system worked well, until a software engineer named Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, the European Agency for Nuclear Research, grew frustrated with the nature of file sharing. He noted that information was spread through many different computers, and you would need to log in to each one separately in order to retrieve the information you needed. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a document that explained the concept that would become the World Wide Web, using an emerging technology called hypertext.(History of the Web.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Hypertext is text that links to other texts.(What is HyperText.) By 1990, Time Berners-Lee had written 3 protocols that would form the World Wide Web. HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, was a language used to format webpages. URI, or Uniform Resource Identifier, which is the web’s addressing system, and third was HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol, which is the protocol which allows one computer to retrieve information from another computer when requested.(History of the Web.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Berners-Lee wasn't alone, there was competition in this sphere. Gopher was an early technology that tried to beat Berners-Lee to the punch. Gopher however, was much more primitive. It had a menu and document type of layout, without the ability to markup(structure) the “webpage”. Thus, everything looked the same, which didn’t appeal to many. A browser called Lynx, was developed at the University of Kansas order to view information over the Gopher network, called the “Gopher-space”.(Nate Anderson)

            <h4>Rise of the consumer web</h4>
            <p>
                The first browser to catch on was Mosaic which was released in 1993. Previous to Mosaic, images, video and such were behind links that you would need to download in order see. Developed at the University of Illinois, it was the first browser that allowed you to see text and pictures side by side. Mosaic eventually became the very popular Netscape Navigator browser, which itself became Firefox, created just 10 years after the first Mosaic browser.(Calore, M.)
