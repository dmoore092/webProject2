                    The World Wide Web is often confused with the Internet. For the majority of people in the world, the Web is how they access the Internet so it comes as no surprise that they believe this. The Web is distinct from the Internet however. The Internet makes up the structure for which the World Wide Web relies on in order to pass information. It's easy to think of the Internet as the roads, and the Web is the vehicles that use the roads to get from one place to another, carrying with them information that needs to be transported.

                    The web started when a researcher at CERN in Switzerland was frustrated with the nature of file sharing. At the time, information was stored across many different machines, and there was no central repository where one could go to access all of it. You would need to log into each computer individually and retrieve the information you needed. This was tedious and cumbersome. The idea was to create a globally linked system where you could publish information without the need to remote logins and having to remember which computer held which information that you needed.

                    Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) was the protocol that was designed to allow the transfer of document over the Internet. The protocol was established in a way that would reduce congestion on the network as well as the latency in transmitting a document over the network.<cite>(Barford, Paul, and Mark Crovella)</cite>
                </p>
                <p style="margin:10px">
                    HTTP relies on the Client/Server model, where a client will send a request to a server, who processes the request and sends back the requested information. When a client(web browser) wants to go to a website, the user types in the address they wish to go to. The address is then translated into an IP(internet protocol) address by a DNS(Domain Name server) server. DNS is a distributed database that links IP addresses to human readable website names that we are used to.<cite>(Anagnostopoulos, M. et al)</cite>

                <p style="margin:10px">
                    A web server will then accept the request, and find the information that is requested and send it back to the requester in the form of HTML/CSS/Javascript. A web browser then translate the information into a human readable form.

                    This process is what allows the World Wide Web to function. Using HTML/CSS/Javascript, developers create rich websites that entertain, and inform. There are currently 3.7 billion people<cite>(World Internet Users Statistics..)</cite> using the Web, and it shows no signs of slowing down.
