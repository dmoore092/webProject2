                    <h3>Vannevar Bush, D.Eng.</h3>
                    <p class="pioneertext">
                        Vannevar Bush was an early pioneer in analog computers. He was the inventer of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer/History-of-computing#toc216034" target="_blank">Differential Analyzer</a>, which was an analog computer that was able to solve complex equations that were impossible before. He was also instrumental in overseeing the Manhattan Project as well as creating the infrastructual framework for government funding for science research. In the field of Computer Science, he proposed the idea of a Memex which is "an indexed, archival, microfilm machine for cross-referencing and retrieving information". This was esentially hypertext  and the World Wide Web.<cite>(Vannevar Bush)</cite>

                    <h3>Doug Englebart, Ph.D</h3>
                    <p class="pioneertext">
                        Called the "Father of the mouse", Doug Englebart was a researcher at Stanford University. In 1961, while attending a conference about computer graphics, he came up with the idea of the mouse while trying to find a way to make interacting with computers more effecient. His early mouse had 3 buttons, and two rollers on the underside. Each roller would track movements across a desk which would be translated onto the screen. Early versions of the mouse included a foot pedal, a knee contraption, and a joystick. The mouse is commonly(incorrectly) believed to have been developed at Xerox's PARC lab, where Apple's founder Steve Jobs saw the mouse and popularized it.<cite>(A., &amp; Connected, M.)</cite>

                    <p class="pioneertext">
                        Ted Nelson coined the term "Hypertext" in 1963. His idea was a "docuverse" where all data was stored once, and accessed from anywhere in the world. Key to his vision was that data would be non-linear, and was able to be jumped through using links. Originally his vision included a concept that data could not be deleted. The current World Wide Web is mostly his realized vision, but information can be deleted from the Web, and occasionally information is stored redundantly. Nelson complete vision was realized in a project called <a href="http://xanadu.com.au/ted/XU/XuPageKeio.html" target="_blank">Project Xanadu</a>. A big part of Project Xanadu is solving the issue of broken links, and version and rights management.<cite>(Ted Nelson Discovers Hypertext)</cite>

                    <p class="pioneertext">
                        Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are the founders of Apple Computer Inc. Steve Wozniak designed the first computer to have a typewriter keyboard and could be connect to a television screen. This design later became Apple's first computer, the Apple I. Steve Jobs saw the potential in Woz's computer and helped to fund its production. Woz would build the computers and Jobs would handle the business side of things, getting the Apple I into shops. Later, on a trip to Xerox's PARC, Jobs was shown the mouse that he later popularized by inclusion into the Apple Lisa computer, which also featured an advanced GUI(Graphical User Interface)<cite>(Rawlinson, N.)</cite>

                    <p class="pioneertext">
                        Inventor of the world Wide Web in 1989, Berners-Lee is the current director of the World Wide Web Consortium(<a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">w3c</a>). While working at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory, in 1989 he proposed the idea of the World Wide Web and wrote the protocols that make up the Web. He wrote the first web client and server in 1990. Berners-Lee co-leads the Decentralized Information Group(<a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank">DIG</a>) at MIT and is a professor in the Comptuer Science department at Oxford University in the UK. He is also the founder and president of the <a href="https://www.odi.org/" target="_blank">open data institute</a> in London, UK. In 2004 he was knighted by H.M. Queen Elizabeth. He openly fights for net neutrality, privacy and openness on the web.<cite>(www.w3.org)</cite>

                    <p class="pioneertext">
                        Marc co-created the Mosaic Internet browser and later cofounded Netscape. While in college, he recruited a team of programmers to create a better way to use the world wide web that had just been created by Tim Berners-Lee. Mosaic used pictures and mouse clicks to navigate through information. Later to avoid copyright issues, he and a cofounder, with a many of the original programmers, rewrote Mosaic and called it Netscape Navigator. He would go on to be the CTO for AOL after they purchased Netscape, and later went on to VC funding and working with start ups.<cite>(Marc Andreessen)</cite>

                    <p class="pioneertext">
                        Rob Hartill is an early pioneer of the World Wide Web, in both the infrastructure and content of the web. In 1994, he cofounded the Apache Software Foundation and contributed significantly to the Apache HTTP(Web) Server. In 1993, while maintaining a movie database, he built a web interface to his database, one of the earliest websites in the UK. This website would later become the Internet Movie Databse(<a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">IMDB</a>). While working for Los Alamos National Lab, Rob was also responsible for working on <a href="http://ArXiv.org" target="_blank">ArXiv.org</a>, which is an E-pring archive that hosts virtually all papers published in the physics field.<cite>(Rob Hartill)</cite>

                    <p class="pioneertext">
                        While attending the University of Kansas, Lou Montulli wrote one of the earliest Web Broswers, called Lynx. Lou was heavily involved in the development of HTTP and HTML as well as creating the concept of web proxying. Later, Lou became one of the founding engineers working on the Mosaic Browser. Lou is responsible for such innovations as cookies, the blink tag in HTML, server push and client pull, HTTPS and animated GIFS in the browser. Lou is a founding member of the HTML working group at the W3C and helped shape innovations such as style sheets and web scripting. Lou was also an early pioneer in live streaming, creating the 2nd ever live camera, called <a href="http://www.fishcam.com/" target="_blank">The Amazing Fish Cam</a> that is still live today.<cite>(Lou.)</cite>

                        Considered "The father of the Internet", Vint Cerf co-designed, with Bob Kahn,  the TCP and IP protocols that underpin the Internet. Cerf was an enginner at DARPA where he worked on developing the ARPAnet. From 2000-2007, Vint served as Chairman of the Board for Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers(<a href="http://www.icann.org" target="_blank">ICANN</a>). He is currently the "Chief Internet Evangelist" at Google, where "he is responsible for identifying new enabling technologies to support the development of advanced, Internet-based products and services".<cite>(Internet Hall of Fame)</cite> Vint tours to speak about Bit Rot, a phenomenon that he believes could lead to a "forgotten century" as digital technology evolves and we lose access to archival information.<cite>(Gibbs S.)</cite>

                        Bob Kahn is the creater of DARPA's Internet Program, and is the co-creator of the TCP and IP protocols with Vint Cerf. He demonstrated his idea by networking 20 computers at an  international computer conference. Dr. Kahn conceived of the idea of "open-archetecture networking" which allowed the Internet to become open to anyone rather than closed. In 2004, Dr. Kahn was the recipient of the ACM Alan M. Turing award, and has received the National Medal of Technology from US President Bill CLinton, as well as the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US President George W. Bush.<cite>(Internet Hall of Fame)</cite>
